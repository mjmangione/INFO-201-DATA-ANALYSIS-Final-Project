# Question 3: How do cities compare to the rest of the US in terms of crime? 
# cities --> high population county
library("dplyr")
library("maps")
source("analysis_final.R")

#visualization --> high population country
#use crime vs rent$ population to ge each crime per 100,000 people 
#out of all valid counties, get the average for each crime/ 100,000 people 
# mutate crime_vs_rent $ population to get each crime per 100,000 people 
# filter so that you only have high population regions ( or choose counties  which are know to contain larger cities)
