# How Does Crime Correlate to Rent Costs Across the United States?
### David Shtukin, Matt Mangione, Amanda Wikramanayake

This repository contains an analysis of the correlation between crime rates and rent prices for different counties in the US. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions in order to guide our understanding of this relationship.

* How do crime rates affect rent prices in counties with particularly high and low crime rates?
* What is the most popular type of crime for each bracket of rent prices?
* How do large population counties compare to the rest of the US in terms of their crime rates?
